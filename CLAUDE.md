# CLAUDE — pd-ocr-cli

CLI tool that turns scanned book pages into clean `.txt` files. Wraps
`pd-book-tools` OCR/layout primitives with auto-rotation, layout-aware
reading-order reconstruction, and a user-facing `pd-ocr` command.

## Commands

| target | does |
|---|---|
| `make setup AI=1` | dev venv + pre-commit hooks (pinned `pd-book-tools` tag) |
| `make local-setup` | setup + clone `../pd-book-tools` for side-by-side editing |
| `make dev-local` | swap pinned dep for editable `../pd-book-tools` in the venv |
| `make test AI=1` | fast suite (`uv run pytest -n auto`; skips `@pytest.mark.slow`) |
| `make test-slow AI=1` | full suite incl. real-model integration tests |
| `make lint AI=1` / `make format AI=1` | ruff |
| `make build AI=1` | sdist + wheel into `dist/` |
| `make ci AI=1` | setup → pre-commit → test → build |
| `make upgrade-pd-book-tools` | bump pin to latest GitHub tag |
| `make release-{patch,minor,major}` | tag locally; `git push --tags` triggers release workflow |
| `make refresh-version` | re-derive `pd-ocr --version` after tag changes (hatch-vcs) |

`AI=1` captures verbose output to `.ci-ai.log`; stdout shows `✅` on pass or
filtered failure sections on error. Remove `AI=1` only if you need full verbose
output for debugging.

Full target list: `make help`. Full dev setup: [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Rules

- Always run `make ci AI=1` before committing.
- Make targets first; fall back to `uv run …` only when no target exists.
- Never `python -m pytest`. Always `uv run pytest -n auto` or `make test`. Bare `python`/`python3`/`.venv/bin/python` miss the venv.
- Never silently drop OCR words. Reorg, caption suppression, and all output paths must preserve every word — roles may change, words may not disappear.
- `--no-illustration-placeholders` (planned) suppresses the placeholder block, not caption text. Caption words must survive in the output.
- `pd-book-tools` is upstream for OCR/layout/image primitives; coordinate with that agent before adding logic that belongs in the library.
- `pd-book-tools` is pinned in `pyproject.toml`; upgrade with `make upgrade-pd-book-tools`.
- Version is derived from git tags via `hatch-vcs` — no hardcoded version in `pyproject.toml`.

## Sibling repos

- `../pd-book-tools/` — upstream dependency. Side-by-side editing: `make local-setup` + `make dev-local`.

## GH issues

Cross-cut work tasks are tracked as GH issues in
**`ConcaveTrillion/ocr-container-meta`** (not in this repo's own tracker).
Plans under `docs/plans/` in the workspace root are synced there
via `/decompose-spec --sync`. Milestone naming: `spec: <plan-basename> (#N)`.

When shipping a plan task:

- Before starting: `gh issue view <N> --repo ConcaveTrillion/ocr-container-meta`
- After completing: `gh issue close <N> --repo ConcaveTrillion/ocr-container-meta`
- List open tasks:
  `gh issue list --repo ConcaveTrillion/ocr-container-meta --milestone "spec: <name> (#N)" --state open`

## docs/ folder

This repo follows the workspace docs/ template — see [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md). Active
folders: `architecture/`, `decisions/`, `plans/`, `process/`, `research/`,
`runbooks/`, `specs/`, `templates/`, `usage/`, plus parallel `archive/`
subfolders.

**Superpowers redirect.** When a superpowers skill (e.g. `brainstorming`,
`writing-plans`) instructs you to save to `docs/superpowers/specs/<file>.md`
or `docs/superpowers/plans/<file>.md`, save to `docs/specs/<file>.md` or
`docs/plans/<file>.md` instead. There is no `docs/superpowers/` subdirectory
in this repo.
